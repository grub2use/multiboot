> Darik's Boot and Nuke, also known as DBAN /ˈdiːbæn/, is an open source project
> hosted on SourceForge. The program is designed to securely erase a hard
> disk until its data is permanently removed and no longer recoverable, which is
> achieved by overwriting the data with pseudorandom numbers generated by
> Mersenne twister or ISAAC. The Gutmann method, Quick Erase, DoD Short (3
> passes), and DOD 5220.22-M (7 passes) are also included as options to handle
> data remanence. DBAN can be booted from a CD, DVD, USB flash drive or diskless
> using a Preboot Execution Environment. It is based on Linux and supports PATA
> (IDE), SCSI and SATA hard drives. DBAN can be configured to automatically wipe
> every hard disk that it sees on a system or entire network of systems, making
> it very useful for unattended data destruction scenarios. DBAN exists for x86
> systems.
