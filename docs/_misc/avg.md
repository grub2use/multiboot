> AVG Rescue CD repairs system crashes and returns your systems to operating at
> full capacity. If malware gets past your security software, you can quickly
> get your PC back up and running smoothly. AVG resellers have been using this
> same solution to recover their customers' infected systems and now it's
> available to your business, free of charge. It's a clean bill of health for
> your system â€” without the bill.
