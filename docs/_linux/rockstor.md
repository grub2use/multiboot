> Rockstor is a specialist CentOS-based Linux distribution designed for Network
> Attached Storage (NAS) and private cloud storage solutions. It is based on
> popular open-source technologies, such as the Btrfs file system and Docker for
> automating the deployment of applications inside software containers. In
> addition to standard NAS features like file sharing via NFS, Samba, SFTP and
> AFP, advanced features such as online volume management, CoW Snapshots,
> asynchronous replication, compression, and bitrot protection are also
> supported. Rockstor provides additional applications, including ownCloud,
> Syncthing, OpenVPN and Plex. These applications (called "Rock-ons") are
> powered by a Docker-based application hosting framework. The Rockstor user
> interface, written in JavaScript, makes it simple to manage the server from
> within a web browser.
